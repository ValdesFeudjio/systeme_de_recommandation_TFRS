# Recommender Systems - ENSAI - TP2
In this lab, you will work with a neural-network-based recommender system. 

You can either work in pairs or alone. If you choose to work in pairs, one of the students in each pair should send me an email with subject  Reco-ENSAI-TP2-Pairs, cc-ing their pair-mate, stating in the body of the email the first and last names of students in the pair.


The repository contains a notebook called NN_based_recommender_system.ipynb. You will need to clone the repository. Copy the notebook into a new file called: 
```[lastname1]-[lastname2]-NN_based_recommender_system.ipynb``` 
where ```[lastname1]``` and ```[lastname2]``` represent the last names of the two members of your lab pair. If you worked alone, please use the following format for the file name. 
```[firstname]-[lastname]-NN_based_recommender_system.ipynb``` 

For example, a group with Mr. John Doe and Jane Appleseed will name their file as follows:
```Appleseed-Doe-NN_based_recommender_system.ipynb``` or ```Doe-Appleseed-NN_based_recommender_system.ipynb```. 

If John Doe works alone, he will instead use the following filename: 
```John-Doe-NN_based_recommender_system.ipynb```. 

You should then edit the notebook wherever indicated by the TODO keyword. There is one TODO that may require submitting an additional file. Name that file using the same convention as above as indicated in the notebook. 

You can either run the notebook on your own machine or on google colab, using the link provided at the top of the notebook. Note that if you use colab, you will have to save the notebook somehow in order to submit it to me. 

You should submit a single zip containing the notebook and the additional file (if any). The zip file should be named: 
```[lastname1]-[lastname2]-Reco-ENSAI-TP2.zip```

or 
```[firstname]-[lastname]-Reco-ENSAI-TP2.zip```

depending on whether you worked in pairs or alone.
